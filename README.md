# Convert mask textures to SDF textures

Welcome! `tex2sdf` is a tool to make SDF textures out of solid shape textures.
The license is MIT, so feel free to use it!

Download a working version from the builds page.

This repository contains the following:
* tex2sdf.h
    * This is an [stb-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb) single-header C library that contains all the actual pixel logic.
    * There are no dependencies, just drop it in and go.
* tex2sdf.exe (`frontend/console/main.c`)
    * This is a console program that uses the `tex2sdf.h` library to load a texture, convert it, and save it out.
    * All functionality of the library is exposed, as command arguments
* tex2sdf_gui.exe (`frontend/gui/main.c`)
    * Coming Soonâ„¢
    * This will eventually be a graphical application, currently it is WIP (in the `uidev` branch).

The main code is mostly a port of Chris Cummings' wonderful C# Unity tool [SignedDistanceFields](github.com/chriscummings100/signeddistancefields).
I wanted a way to use it outside of Unity, so here it is.
Check out his [article series about SDFs](https://shaderfun.com/2018/03/23/signed-distance-fields-part-1-unsigned-distance-fields/), you won't regret it!

## FAQ

### What is the license?

This is MIT-licensed, since it is a port of C# code written by someone else.
The original repository is at [chriscummings100/signeddistancefields](github.com/chriscummings100/signeddistancefields).

Please note that the original repository does not have a license.
I was given permission to license this under MIT by an explicit comment, in [this blog article's comments section](https://shaderfun.com/2018/07/23/signed-distance-fields-part-8-gradients-bevels-and-noise/).
**If this is too uncertain for you license-wise, please refrain from using this repository.**
I claim no responsibility in the event the original author retracts his statement.

### What is SDF?

### Why C? Why header-only?

After searching for the best SDF conversion code, I found it, but it was in Unity C#.
Since I needed this for a non-Unity project, it was necessary to have something outside of Unity.

I chose C for maximum portability, to make sure that I and anyone who needed it could for sure use it from anywhere.
The reason behind making it an [stb-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb) "single-header" library is to remove as much friction as possible and allow just dropping it in.

Since this is mostly just a port, a lot of the code remains mostly the same, besides naming conventions.
There are likely performance or structural improvements that can be made, but it is satisfactory at the moment for my purposes.

### What is the algorithm behind the converter?

This uses an Eikonal sweep algorithm, for the smoothest result.

(This project is mostly a port of C# code from the article, I have yet to dig deep at how the alogrithm works)
